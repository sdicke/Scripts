# Scripts
Miscellaneous shell scripts

update.sh proceeds a system upgrade on apt based systems.

showips.sh shows a list of interfaces with its IP addresses (needs getip.sh and interfaces.sh int the same directory)

interfaces.sh extract interfaces names from ip addr output

getcursors.sh fetches and installs the Debian packages Oxygencursors (my prefered cursors package, especially needfully on non-debian systems)

ramdisc.sh Creates a ramdisc, mount it in the given directory and allow the given user the rights to work with this directory

getip.sh shows the ip address(es) for the given IP protocol version for the given interface.
